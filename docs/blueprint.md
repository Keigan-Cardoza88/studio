## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Grey (#A3A3A3) to evoke creativity and musicality. This strikes a balance between modern and energetic, avoiding being overly trendy or cliche.
- Background color: Black (#000000), a desaturated and bright color derived from the same purple hue, but in a light scheme.
- Accent color: Aqua (#00FFB2) to provide contrast, being close to purple but different enough to highlight interactive elements and CTAs.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and short amounts of body text and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for longer text.
- Use clean and modern icons for setlist management, song editing, and settings.
- The UI/UX should be optimized for a mobile in the ratio 9:16, and should have a expandable and retractable sidebar.
- Design a clear and intuitive layout with easy navigation between setlists, songs, and settings.
- Incorporate subtle animations for smooth transitions and user feedback, enhancing the user experience without being distracting.
